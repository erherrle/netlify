For this assignment, I created a one-page HTML cheat sheet on how to create a test repository in GitHub. I used an HTML sheet to edit and add instructions, links, and images to my site and a style sheet to change fonts, font sizes, and colors. 
Finally, I pushed my site to GitHub and published on a domain provided by Netlify.
