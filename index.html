	<p>If you've managed to find your way to GitHub, you would have been greeted by this cheeky little cat. If you see him, you're in the right place.</p>

	<p>Let's walk through the steps of creating your first test repository.</p>

	<p>Here is what you will need to get started:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A GitHub Account</li>
		<li>Terminal</li>
		<li>Sublime Text</li>

		<h2>Creating your Repository</h2>

		<p>Once you have logged into your GitHub account, you should click the green button that says "New" at the top left corner of your browser in the section titled "Repositories".</p>
		<p>Once you have named and created your repository, this will prompt step by step instructions to follow when setting up your repository in Terminal.</p>
		<p>Create a folder on your desktop with the same name as your repository to store your files.</p>

		<h2>Setting Things up in Terminal</h2>
		<p>This is definitely the most difficult part, but hang tight and pay attention to details.</p>
		<p>Begin by establishing your location in terminal. To do this type "cd" press space and then drag the file you just created for your repository from your desktop and into the Terminal window. Press enter.</p>
		<p>Next you will type the following commands provided by GitHub into terminal:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>echo "# testforproject" >> README.md</li>
			<li>git init</li>
			<li>git add README.md</li>
			<li>git commit -m "first commit"</li>
			<li>git branch -M main</li>
			<li>git remote add origin (COPY AND PASTE LINK FOR YOUR SITE - EX: git add origin https://github.com/erherrle/testforproject.git)</li>
			<li>git push -u origin main</li>

		</ol>
		<p>Tip: Press "return" after each step. </p>

		<h2>Start Creating Your Site</h2>
		<p>Open Sublime Text and create two new files one titled "index.html" and the other "style.css". We will then add both files to your repository's folder on your desktop and push them to GitHub.</p>
		<p>To do this type the following commands into Terminal:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>git add index.html</li>
			<li>git commit -am "added index.html"</li>
			<li>git push origin main</li>
			
		</ol>

		<p>Do the same for your style file.</p>

		<h2>Add Content to your Site</h2>
		<p>Now you can begin coding in html on Sublime and add content to your site.</p>
		<p>Don't forget to save frequently and push your changes to GitHub by following the three steps above.</p>
		<p>Use the command "git status" to make sure you have commited everything and "your working tree is <img src= "sparkles.png">clean.<img src= "sparkles.png"></p>
