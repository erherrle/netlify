	<p>If you've managed to find your way to GitHub, you would have been greeted by this cheeky little cat. If you see him, you're in the right place.</p>

	<p>Let's walk through the steps of creating your first test repository.</p>

	<p>Here is what you will need to get started:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A GitHub Account</li>
		<li>Terminal</li>
		<li>Sublime Text</li>

		<h2>Creating your Repository</h2>

		<p>Once you have logged into your GitHub account, you should click the green button that says "New" at the top left corner of your browser in the section titled "Repositories".</p>
		<p>This will prompt step by step instructions to follow when setting up your repository in Terminal.</p>

	<h2>Setting Things up in Terminal</h2>
		<p>This is definitely the most difficult part, but hang tight and pay attention to details.</p>
